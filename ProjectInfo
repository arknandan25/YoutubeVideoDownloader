The project is made using pytube-plugin for downloading youtube videos.
Front is made using tkinter, the progress bar is a bit fucked up, there seemed to be some problem with time.sleep, so can't see it progressing properly.
User directory can be set or be input from user.
Current features and specifications:
  1. Download videos entering link
  2. Save them in a predefined directory
  3. View progress of video download
Features for future:
  1. Selecting video quality on GUI
  2. Download playlist
